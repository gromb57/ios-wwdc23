## Overview

### Grid
@Row {
    @Column(size: 2) {
        First, you customize your sloth by picking its 
        ``AnimationView``. The power of your sloth influences
        its abilities and how well they cope in their environment. The app
        displays a picker view that showcases the available powers and
        previews your sloth for the selected power.
    }
    
    @Column {
        ![A screenshot of the power picker user interface with four powers displayed â€“ ice, fire, wind, and lightning](swift-og)
    }
}

@Row {
    @Column {
        ![A screenshot of the sloth status user interface that indicates the the amount of sleep, fun, and exercise a given sloth is in need of.](swift-og)
    }
    
    @Column(size: 2) {
        Once you've customized your sloth, it's ready to ready to thrive.
        You'll find that sloths will happily munch on a leaf, but may not be as 
        receptive to working out. Use the activity picker to send some
        encouragement.
